# Starway to Orione: the Orione Team Learning Path

This is the learning path every new dev has to follow when joins our team.

This path reflect our team's culture and values, which have its roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/), as well as in those of XP, and in the [software craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

Please feel free to fork and contribute, add materials, fix the existing ones and propose new stuff.

## Main learning path

### Session 1 - Intro

* Read [The Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) paper
* Read first three chapters of [XP Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416)
* Read first chapter of ["Applying UML and Patterns"](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062)
  * Try to estimate the time needed to study that chapter (using the pomodoro technique)
  * Answer (for example on the team's wiki pages)
    * What is analysis?
    * What is design?
    * What's the difference between them?
    * What is design for?
      * in other words, how would you reply to the following statement: _"I just need to understand what to do (analysis) and than do it (coding). Everything else does not matter!"_
* Read the article [Keep It DRY, Shy, and Tell the Other Guy](http://media.pragprog.com/articles/may_04_oo1.pdf)
* Tell Don't Ask principle
  * read the article [Tell, Don't Ask](http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask)
  * read the article [The Art of Enbugging](http://media.pragprog.com/articles/jan_03_enbug.pdf)
* Do the [Kata String Calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

### Session 2 - Testing and TDD

* Read [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530)
* See the Clean Code Talks series: these four videos (and the related blogpost series) are really valuable to learn how to design for testability.

  1. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks -- Unit Testing" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w) (~ 30 minutes) [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mZsq0WljEfgIR9Df_IcW0VQfNl-Pk_cEBR3i9id-eR4/present#slide=id.i0)]. Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/04/clean-code-talks-unit-testing/).

  2. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks -- Inheritance, Polymorphism, & Testing" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F72VULWFvc) (~ 40 minutes). Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/12/08/clean-code-talks-inheritance-polymorphism-testing/) (there you can find the slides too).

  3. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks - Don't Look For Things!" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0) (~ 35 minutes) which talks about the Dependency Injection pattern. Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/11/clean-code-talks-dependency-injection/) (there you can find the slides too).

  4. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks - "Global State and Singletons" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FRm3VPhseI) (~ 55 minutes). Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/21/clean-code-talks-global-state-and-singletons/) (there you can find the slides too).

  5. For each video you see, write a short post (e.g. on your public [gist](https://gist.github.com/)) on
    * what you learn
    * what puzzled you most?

  6. Read Mi≈°ko Hevery's guide on ["Writing Testable Code"](http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/)
* See [Lets Play on TDD](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play) by James Shore
* For __italian speakers__, Piergiuliano Bossi's [screencasts on TDD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKu3XCVh7pe06khn4N1uCiQ) are a good starting point: there are five basic lession and a final video on emergent design.
* Do the [Sales Kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/sales-taxes-problem) in TDD
* Extra: Follow the [The World's Best Intro to TDD](http://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01) by J. B. Rainsberger
